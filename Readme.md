# Vancouver tech on a map

This is a just a little mash up using Google docs forms/spreadsheets to easily show the tech startup scene in Vancouver.

I built this so that it would be easier for others to see what's going on in vancouver and where.

## Todo:

- Pull and parse spreadsheet and render placeholders on the map
- Show information when clicked
- Google font to be the same as the form theme.
- hide the iframe when a company is added
